# Architecture Decisions

## 001 — Development environment

Use Windows 10 with WSL2, Ubuntu and Docker Desktop.

## 002 — Project location

Store the project in the WSL Linux filesystem:

    /home/rado/projects/company-ai

Do not develop directly under `/mnt/c/`.

## 003 — Automation

Prefer repeatable Bash scripts instead of long manual command sequences.

Every maintained Bash script should contain a `# Description:` header and be registered by the automatic scripts inventory.

## 004 — Platform structure

Build a modular MVP with:

- dashboard;
- backend API;
- local agent;
- database;
- integrations;
- configuration;
- storage;
- administration.

## 005 — Integration design

External email and phone platforms must be replaceable through configuration and adapters.

Business logic must not depend directly on one external provider.

## 006 — Company separation

Multiple companies must use isolated company context, credentials and data.

Company-owned database records must include a company identifier.

## 007 — Environment secrets

Generate the local `.env` file from `.env.example`.

Generate secure random development secrets automatically.

Never print generated secrets to the terminal and never commit `.env` to Git.

## 008 — PostgreSQL version and storage

Use `postgres:18-alpine` for the current development database.

Mount persistent PostgreSQL storage at:

    /var/lib/postgresql

Expose PostgreSQL on local host port `5433` to avoid common host conflicts.

## 009 — Backend architecture

Use FastAPI with separated layers:

    API routes
    Schemas
    Services
    Repositories
    SQLAlchemy models
    Database session

API routes must not contain direct database business logic.

## 010 — Database migrations

Use Alembic for every database schema change.

Do not create or modify database tables directly from application startup code.

Maintain one linear migration head unless a deliberate migration branch is documented.

## 011 — Company identifiers

Use UUID values as internal Company identifiers.

Use a unique lowercase kebab-case slug as the human-readable stable identifier.

Company names do not need to be unique.

## 012 — Company status

Store a company status and an active flag in the initial Company model.

Supported initial status values:

    active
    inactive

Future lifecycle states require a documented migration.

## 013 — Development company

Use the following temporary Company Context during development:

    Name: CompanyTest
    Slug: company-test

The real company must later be created as a separate Company record.

Development data must not be silently renamed into production data.

## 014 — API versioning

Expose the backend application API under:

    /api/v1

Incompatible API behavior must use a new API version rather than silently breaking existing clients.

## 015 — Phase progression

Non-blocking tasks from an earlier phase may remain in the backlog while foundational work in the next phase begins.

They must remain documented and be completed before MVP stabilization.

## 016 — Company slug updates

The Company UUID is the permanent canonical identifier.

A company slug may be changed through the controlled Company update endpoint when the new slug remains unique.

Internal relations must use the Company UUID rather than the mutable slug.
