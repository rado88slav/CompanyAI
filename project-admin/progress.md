## Automated Verification

Latest backend verification:

    39 passed, 1 warning

The warning is a non-blocking Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning.

Alembic migration chain:

    <base> -> 0001_initial -> 0002_companies -> 0003_company_settings -> 0004_administrators (head)

## Current API

    GET  /
    GET  /api/v1/health
    GET  /api/v1/health/ready
    POST /api/v1/auth/login
    GET  /api/v1/auth/me
    POST /api/v1/companies
    GET  /api/v1/companies
    GET   /api/v1/companies/{company_id}
    PATCH /api/v1/companies/{company_id}
    POST  /api/v1/companies/{company_id}/activate
    POST  /api/v1/companies/{company_id}/deactivate
    PUT    /api/v1/companies/{company_id}/settings/{category}/{key}
    GET    /api/v1/companies/{company_id}/settings
    GET    /api/v1/companies/{company_id}/settings/{category}/{key}
    DELETE /api/v1/companies/{company_id}/settings/{category}/{key}

Company and Company Settings routes require a valid administrator Bearer token.

## Current Docker Services

### PostgreSQL

- image: `postgres:18-alpine`;
- internal port: `5432`;
- local host port: `5433`;
- persistent volume enabled;
- health check operational.

### Backend

- image: `company-ai-backend:dev`;
- framework: FastAPI;
- local host port: `8000`;
- PostgreSQL readiness check operational;
- container health check operational.

## Current Development Company

    ID: 0138bfbe-80af-4304-ad91-14d1914a9869
    Name: CompanyTest
    Slug: company-test
    Status: active

`CompanyTest` is temporary development data.

The real company will later be created as a separate Company Context without changing the database architecture.
